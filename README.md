### Running the Server

To run the backend server, execute the following command:

```bash
pipenv run python main.py
```

The server will start on http://localhost:5000/ by default.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests and check the test coverage, use the following command:

```bash
pipenv run coverage run --source=main,api_handler -m unittest test_api.py && pipenv run coverage report
```

This command will execute the tests and display the coverage report in the terminal.
